# bureaucracy

This is the central repo for guidelines and operational structures in the TShock family of projects. Because many processes are the same across all projects and repositories, it makes sense to have one central location for everything.

This will eventually house all pull request guidelines, issue guidelines, contributor guidelines and more. In addition, it will eventually hold operational guides for TShock staff. Think of it like the handbook to running TShock, the project and organization.
